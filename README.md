# Scripted Tool Repository

This is a place to share and to store scripts which I've developed to simplify administrative tasks that I encounter. Some have very narrow applications and others are building blocks for the everyday menu I keep open in my terminal. This collection reflects my growth over a few years, as I have become more familiar with PowerShell and its structure and capabilities. I've attempted to comment inside most of the files to describe what they do, or at least how the commands work. 
## Use

These scripts assume that you have the abiility to run commands in an Active Directory environment with administrative privileges. Some of them also assume that you have a google domain as well, and have installed GAM to access google admin commands through the command line.
